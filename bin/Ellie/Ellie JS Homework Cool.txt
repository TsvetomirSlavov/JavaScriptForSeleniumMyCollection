3) Locate the floating menu “In This Section” on the right side of the article.

4) Scroll the page down, and check that the floating menu is now at the bottom of the article

5) Scroll the page up, and ensure the floating menu is at the top of the article (it will be offset from the top by the ad height + 20 pixels)


Hints:
If you are using dom to locate an element, remember that most get* functions will return an array of elements, only getElementById returns an element.
To find the parent of an element use element.parentNode
To figure out the height of any element use element.offsetHeight

Have fun ;)
